      <description>Biography I am post-doctoral researcher in computer security at the LAAS-CNRS of Toulouse in France. I work with Vincent Migliore on the design of processors secure against side-channel attacks (power consumption and electromagnetic fields measurements).  Previously, I was graduated from the PHELMA - Grenoble INP engineering school in electronics and microelectronics. Then, during my PhD, I was working at Inria in the CIDRE Team advised by Ronan Lashermes.
